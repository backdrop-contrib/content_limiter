Content Limiter
======================
Content Limiter provides options for limiting the scope of content for any given type. 
After enabling limiting the content type will be restricted to retain a specific amount 
of content pieces. When a content piece is added that exceeds the limit, Content Limiter 
will delete as many items needed to enforce the set limit. The default maximum content 
pieces deleted at one time is 25 and can be changed on the configuration page. Other 
configuration includes enabling site messages, watchdog entries and a kill switch to turn 
off limiting for all types.

All lines in this file should be no more than 80 characters long for legibility,
unless including a URL or example that requires the line not wrap. (The first
line of this paragraph is 80 characters for reference.)

Detail in READMEs should be limited to the minimum required for installation and
getting started. More detailed documentation should be moved to a GitHub wiki
page: https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/setup/wiki/Documentation.
